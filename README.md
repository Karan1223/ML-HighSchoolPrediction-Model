# ML-HighSchoolPrediction-Model


Machine Learning Model To predict if a student would attend college or not.

Dataset Description:
This dataset contains various columns including Type_School, school_accreditation, Interest, 
Residence, Parents_Age, Parents_Salary, Average Grades, and Parent was in college.The dataset 
has 1000 records. Parents_salary is in Indonesian Rupee. While most of data has just two classes.

Dataset Analysis:
For this dataset most of the data has two classes so I did one hot encoding and converted data 
into 1 and 0. While I didnâ€™t change parent_age, parent_salary, and Average_grades.
While Interest has 5 classes which are interested, not interested, very interested, uncertain, and 
less interested and mapped them from 0 to 4.

Prediction Model:
For this project I used two prediction model Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

Results: So, the accuracy of Logistic Regression, to 
predict if a student would attend college or not is 
80% while on the other hand, accuracy of Random 
Forest Classifier is 70%.

Comparing both the models: So, it can be said that 
accuracy to predict, if a student would attend
College or not, of Logistic Regression model is 
morewhen compared to Random Forest Classifier.
